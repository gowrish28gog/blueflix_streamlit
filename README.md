# Blueflix  Streamlit

The idea of starting a project on [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io) came from wanting to study a new tool. With ease of streamlit provides for the development of projects is incredible. I had done a project in college of a jupyter notebook being for movie recommendations, after that I continued with [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/sc0v1n0/k-means-recommend-movies-and-tv-shows-netflix). Wanting to learn Streamlit why not combine the two projects. So I developed this project to apply this knowledge. I hope to write an article about the development. For now I'm still in development, for new updates.
